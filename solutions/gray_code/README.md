## Description

The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer _n_ representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. 
A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

For example, given _n_ = 2, return `[0,1,3,2]`. Its gray code sequence is:
```
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2
```

**Note:**  

For a given _n_, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.

For example, `[0,2,3,1]` is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.

For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.
