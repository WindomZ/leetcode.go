# [91. Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/description/)

## Description

A message containing letters from `A-Z` is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
```
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
```

Given an encoded message containing digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

For example,  

Given encoded message `"12"`,
it could be decoded as `"AB"` (1 2) or `"L"` (12).

The number of ways decoding `"12"` is 2.
