## Description

Given a linked list and a value _x_, partition it such that all nodes less than _x_ come before nodes greater than or equal to _x_.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

For example,  

Given `1->4->3->2->5->2` and _x_ = 3,  

return `1->2->2->4->3->5`.
