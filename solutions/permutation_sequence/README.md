# 60. Permutation Sequence

## Description

The set `[1,2,3,…,_n_]` contains a total of _n_! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,  

We get the following sequence (ie, for _n_ = 3):

1.  `“123“`
2.  `“132“`
3.  `“213“`
4.  `“231“`
5.  `“312“`
6.  `“321“`

Given _n_ and _k_, return the _k_th permutation sequence.

**Note:** Given _n_ will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
