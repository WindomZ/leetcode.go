## Description

Given a _m_ x _n_ grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which _minimizes_ the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example 1:**  
```
[1,3,1],
[1,5,1],
[4,2,1]]
```

Given the above grid map, return `7`. Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
